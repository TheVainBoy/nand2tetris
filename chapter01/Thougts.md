Things
======
This is world built on two things.

What those two things are depends on where you are.  
  - If your looking at electronics the two things are 'on' and 'off'.  
  - In maths we might think of '0' and '1'.  
  - In boolean logic we might use 'true' and 'false'.
  - In everyday speech we might think 'have' and 'have not'

Holders
=======
A single thing can be held by a 'holder' that's a horrible name which is ok
because we have lots of other names for holders.
  - In electronics we might think of it as a pin, a wire or bus that is either
    'on' or 'off'.  In maths it could be a symbol.  
  - In computing we might think of it as a variable or a bit.

Combiners
=========
A combiner on or more input and output holders.  The thing (value) held by the
outputs depends on the things (values) held by the inputs.
  - In electronics we might call it a gate or chip.
  - In maths we might call it a function.
  - In computing we might call it a function, method or procedure.

In electronics wires/pins are on or off and combined using gates and chips.
In maths symbols have values and are combined using functions.
In computing a bit is 0 or 1 and is combined with functions or methods.
